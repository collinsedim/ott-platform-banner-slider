This repository contains a simple banner slider code that can be used to create an engaging and dynamic slideshow for showcasing featured movies or shows, similar to those seen on popular OTT streaming platforms. The banner slider is built using React and integrated with the Swiper library, providing smooth and responsive sliding transitions.
